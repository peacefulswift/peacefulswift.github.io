# Pre-WWDC25 Thoughts

WWDC25 is just around the corner.  

It’s always a special time for developers—especially for those of us who build, ship, and live inside the Apple ecosystem.

I used to take time off just to enjoy the sessions. I still get excited when I see talks that connect to my daily work or spark ideas for hobby projects. The way new APIs and tools are introduced is always inspiring.

But every year, there’s also a bit of frustration.

It’s fun to explore new APIs and build quick prototypes. Some of the ideas behind these frameworks are truly impressive.  

But in real-world projects, we don’t always get to use the latest tools.

We need to support older OS versions. So even if a new feature solves a long-standing problem, we often can’t adopt it right away—and by the time we can, it might already be outdated.

That’s tough. But what’s worse is when new tools end up *hurting* existing projects.

I remember someone joking like:

> “Its already 2018, Why are we still using programmatic constraints instead of Storyboard?”

Personally, I think Storyboards were a mistake...

They’re fine for small apps—but hard to scale.  
You end up fighting the system, and the pain of migrating later is real.

When I was at Agoda, our Flights team decided to go fully programmatic—no SnapKit, no Storyboards—and it turned out to be the right call. That decision saved us years of frustration. I’m still proud of that project, and of everyone who contributed to building it. It’s a bit sad to hear that it will soon be replaced by something else.

I’ve definitely made my share of wrong decisions in the past. But one important lesson I’ve learned is to be cautious when adopting shiny new tools or frameworks. *Always make sure they’re easy to remove* *or replace if things don’t work out.*

I’d be lying if I said I haven’t fallen into that trap before—but now, I try to remind myself of this lesson every time I’m tempted by something new and shiny.
